Go to Hotel Debord
Navia
I came here several times with my father when I was little, but stopped eating here as often after growing up. I hope the food here will be to your tastes.
Paimon
Oh, don't worry, we haven't eaten at a hotel like this in a while. Hehe, Paimon's getting excited already!
Navia
In that case, I'll go order for us first. Please wait here a moment.
Paimon
Oho, everything looks so good! People in Fontaine sure know how to enjoy life.
Navia
Why, of course. Go ahead, try whatever you like. If the food's good, I'll make a group reservation for the rest of Spina di Rosula next time.
Paimon
And if it's not?
Navia
Well, ah... Then I'll still bring everyone, albeit with only one dish per table.
Paimon
You uh, sure have your own way of doing things...
Paimon
Oh, we called this a farewell meal, but we could also treat it like a victory feast, right? We did just win that case, after all.
It's certainly worth celebrating.
It was a pleasure working with you.
Traveler
It's certainly worth celebrating.
Navia
Ooh, true, very true. In that case... Boss, we'll have another two dishes!
Paimon
Huh! Paimon didn't mean that you had to order even more food!
Navia
Hehe...
Paimon
Speaking of cases, do you think that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances will get caught soon now that this all has happened?
Navia
We've certainly taken a big step forward, but I feel that's about it. We know that there is an organization that means to dissolve these young women, but we still don't know what they are really after.
Paimon
If it hadn't happened right in front of us, Paimon wouldn't have ever believed that a person could be dissolved like that...
Navia
Right? Yet it was because this was such a preposterous notion that the investigation could never really move forward before.
Paimon
Ugh, if only that guy could've finished speaking... *sigh* We were so close to hearing who was behind it.
Navia
In such investigations, even the smallest step can seem like a yawning chasm if the trail of clues is cut off.
Navia
To be honest, I don't have high hopes for any follow-up that the authorities might conduct...
Navia
It's not that I don't have faith in their ability, it's just that a different perspective is required in some matters.
Navia
It's easy to guard against and deceive a single, narrow perspective. A shift in thinking is required at such times in order to produce a breakthrough.
Navia
Which is exactly why the Spina di Rosula exist.
Navia
Those highfalutin folk are not all-knowing. That's why we exist, to seep into the cracks where filth falls through, where their watch fails them. That's the kinds of problems we solve.
Paimon
Huh. Seems Paimon thought things were simpler than they actually are...
Navia
*sigh* It's alright. Well, this was supposed to be a farewell meal, so I doubt you have further interest in this business, right?
Navia
Let's talk about something else. Like... what are your future plans?
We wanted to ask the Hydro Archon for some information...
But we haven't had much opportunity to do so.
Traveler
We wanted to ask the Hydro Archon for some information...
Paimon
That's true. We didn't have a chance to speak to her after the trial ended. It didn't really seem like the right time or place to do it anyway...
Navia
I see. So your primary objective — which has been foiled so far — was to have a chat with the Hydro Archon.
Navia
I've heard that there's a long line of people waiting to meet Lady Furina. I suspect you'll be waiting for quite a while, considering that you missed your chance today.
Paimon
Yeah, we've heard that she's super popular here in Fontaine, and that it'll be tough getting any of her time.
Navia
Hmm, well... Would you consider some more... unique ways? Perhaps even methods of, let's say, questionable legality?
Paimon
Guess that's Spina di Rosula's Boss for you... Chock-full of sketchy ideas. Well, what did you have in mind?
Navia
Well, one way would be to infiltrate a performance troupe at the opera house, only to abandon your act at the play's climax and ask to speak to her after the performance...
Navia
I'm sure Lady Furina would be eager to see the ending, and would agree in order to finish watching the play, don't you think?
Paimon
Uh, could you suggest something a little more... practical? This plan seems pretty hard to pull off. We'd have to go learn how to act, and acting's really hard!
Navia
Alright, here's another...find a way to conceal yourselves under her bed. Then, wake her up in the dead of night and demand answers. Don't let her go back to sleep until she answers all your questions!
Navia
I can personally testify that this one works. When I'm sleepy, I'll do anything as long as I can finally get some sleep!
Paimon
Uh, that might work, but that's not really the problem. The problem is we don't want to get ourselves arrested.
Navia
Ah, valid point. I overlooked that part. I was just thinking about leveraging a person's desire for sleep.
Traveler
How can you overlook something like that!?
Navia
Alright, alright, no more joking around. Perhaps you could... oh I don't know, cut the line when she's on a break.
Navia
You did defeat her in court, clearing citizens of hers from false accusations — false accusations she had nearly upheld personally. I'd imagine that she feels quite ashamed about the whole thing...
Paimon
You mean that if we catch her while she's on a break, she might be too embarrassed to refuse? That does make some sense.
It's worth a try.
Would someone with her personality really feel shame?
Traveler
It's worth a try.
Paimon
Why don't we give it a try after this meal? Y'know, strike while the iron is hot and all...
Navia
Huh? Paimon, did you drink my Fonta?
Paimon
Huh? Was this your drink?
Paimon
Ehehe, sorry about that. Paimon wasn't really paying attention, and the cup was right next to Paimon... Would you like to order another?
Navia
No, it's fine. We're just about done here.
Paimon
Alright. Honestly, Paimon wouldn't recommend Fonta anyway. It tastes kinda salty and icky.
I'd have to agree.
My drink also tasted that way, too.
Traveler
I'd have to agree.
Navia
Is that so? Well, in that case, we'll have to blacklist the Fonta here, then.
Navia
If we're all finished eating, then I'll go pay...
Paimon
Yeah, we're stuffed. Thanks for the treat, Navia!
Talk to Navia
Paimon
Ooh, so... full... Paimon can barely float anymore...
You could try walking, you know.
You could try floating a little lower.
Traveler
You could try walking, you know.
Paimon
Nah, that would be so... normal. Y'know, like you.
Navia
Hmm... Okay, as for expenses this month, we're left with...
Paimon
Hey Navia, what are you doing over there?
Navia
Oh, nothing, nothing! It was just a meal, y'know. Nothin' the Spina di Rosula can't cover, haha... *sigh*
(Seems that was pretty tough for her.)
(That was a pretty pricey meal, all thanks to Paimon...)
Traveler
(Seems that was pretty tough for her.)
Paimon
Let's get ready to try to meet the Hydro Archon again. Bye, Navia!
Navia
*sigh* So this is goodbye, huh. Well, if you do encounter any other trouble in Fontaine, you're always welcome to contact the Spina di Rosula — I'll give your request the highest priority.
Navia
In any case, I wish you smooth sailing. I'll see you again, partner!
Paimon
See ya!
Go to the fountain plaza in front of the opera house
Paimon
There aren't many people around anymore. Looks like that boat we took to Erinnyes might have been the last one...
???
"Vacher..."
Paimon
Huh, looks like we're back here again...
Paimon
Huh, Traveler? Are you hearing voices again?
Yes...
And it's clearer than it was during the day.
Traveler
Yes...
Paimon
Uhhh... That's kinda spooky. Are you sure we don't wanna come back in the morning?
???
"Vacher... Vacher..."
Paimon
Hey! Why're you still walking towards it? There might be something nasty in the water...
(I can feel... strong emotions...)
(Things are... getting a little blurry...)
Traveler
(I can feel... strong emotions...)
Paimon
Huh? Hang on, Paimon can kinda hear a voice... It's calling for "Vacher," right?
Paimon
Hey, Traveler! Stop walking! C'mon, wake up!
Talk to the Oceanid
Oceanid?
...
...
Where's this?
Traveler
...
Oceanid?
Vacher? Are you... my dear Vacher?
Oceanid?
No, wait, you seem to be someone else... Do you know Vacher? Do you know where my love is?
I'm afraid not...
I'm sorry, who are you?
Traveler
I'm afraid not...
Oceanid?
I'm... Wait, who am I...? I'm very sorry, I fear I do not know.
Oceanid?
My memories feel like they have been washed away like a flood. So many fragments dissolved amidst the tide, never to be recovered.
Oceanid?
How much have I lost? How many things that I once held dear while on land have I since forgotten?
You were once...
...Human?
Traveler
You were once...
Oceanid?
Yes, that is what I was once. But now, I am but the consciousness of one who has lost their form.
Traveler
You lost your form...
Oceanid?
I do not know how I came to be like this either. I only vaguely remember being covered in light blue water, and then all grew dim...
"Light blue water"... Could that have been...
Could she be one of the girls who were dissolved?
Traveler
"Light blue water"... Could that have been...
Oceanid?
Ah, I also remember going to many places. I loved adventure, loved exploring places of peril.
Oceanid?
No matter where I went, Vacher would go with me. I knew how dearly he loved me, and I also loved him equally as much.
Oceanid?
But now... We can no longer go back. The pain of such parting... I never knew how heavy it could be.
Traveler
So you need me to find him?
Oceanid?
No! Our reunion no longer has any meaning — there is no way for us to create any new memories.
Oceanid?
The thought of me gives him no succor, so let it lie forgotten beneath the waters.
Oceanid?
If you meet Vacher, tell him not to look for me. Tell him to move on — that is the only thing I still remember.
Traveler
I believe it will be hard for him to forget you.
Oceanid?
Perhaps that is so... As I was submerged in the waters, losing consciousness, I saw Vacher above the surface. His eyes were filled with such sorrow, such longing.
Oceanid?
If only I could have comforted him, told him that I did not suffer. Indeed, I had felt a great warmth...
That means...
Vacher was a witness to the fact that you dissolved?
Traveler
That means...
Oceanid?
Is that what you call it? "Dissolving"? If anything, I consider it a form of "release."
Oceanid?
It was a state of neither fear nor frenzy, with only an endless peace, like the water's still surface.
Oceanid?
I could also liken it to being a thirsty person who drinks water for the first time, and only then sees how they have lived for so long in a world of endless want and anxiety.
It seems that after the body is dissolved...
Some measure of the consciousness still remains...
Traveler
It seems that after the body is dissolved...
Oceanid?
I think I hear your companion. It's time for you to go, I think.
Is that Paimon...?
Ah right, I wonder how much time has passed in reality...
Traveler
Is that Paimon...?
Oceanid?
Farewell, then. I am glad that you were able to sense my presence. Remember, if you see Vacher, tell him not to seek me out any longer.
Talk to Navia
Navia
I should thank you for lending us your sword there, Clorinde. But before I do so, could you explain how you managed to show up here?
Clorinde
I... followed you. It seemed to me that danger has followed you more closely as of late.
Navia
I believe that following someone without their knowledge is actually called "stalking," is it not?
Clorinde
Mr. Callas' last wish was for me to ensure your safety, and I will not betray his trust. He would do the same, were he alive today.
Navia
Do not... speak of my father.
Silver
Sorry Demoiselle, I was not strong enough...
Melus
Thank you for your aid, Ms. Clorinde, but do keep an eye out for your manner of speech. I believe we all wish to avoid unnecessary emotional harm.
Clorinde
Sorry. I... did not consider your feelings.
Navia
Whatever. What else do you know? How did you come to the conclusion that I'd be in grave danger?
Clorinde
I doubt I know much more than you, but I believe that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances is very powerful.
Clorinde
Your performance tonight will almost certainly attract their attention.
Navia
Hehe, I'm sure they've known about me. To be honest, I'm shocked it's taken them this long to act against me.
Navia
And what about these Gardemeks? I thought only those associated with the Maison Gardiennage could control them.
Clorinde
None of these meka have serial numbers, I was sure to check a moment ago. They are not the ones used by the authorities to enforce the law.
Clorinde
I can only conclude that some powerful or wealthy party must have obtained them via illegal means, deploying them as a private force of sorts.
Navia
What, your point being that they're out of the Spina di Rosula's league then?
Clorinde
Yes. Be careful, and do not act rashly.
Navia
I will continue investigating no matter what. We will bring the truth to light. That's... my father's true last wish.
Navia
Regardless, thank you for your help today, Clorinde. But if you get any ideas, tell me first. I don't much appreciate being followed.
Clorinde
I do not think that they'll strike again any time soon, so I shall stop following you. Good day, all.
Navia
Right. I suppose that's the best news we've gotten today.
Melus
Demoiselle, I believe that Ms. Clorinde was being sincere with you. If we tried, we could attempt to thaw relations a little...
Navia
*sigh* I know. I just... She's...
What just happened?
Who was that?
Traveler
What just happened?
Paimon
Thank goodness! Paimon thought we were done for!
Paimon
Those Gardemeks came outta nowhere while you were unconscious, and Navia and her gang saved us.
Paimon
Oh, and there was that Champion Duelist named Clorinde who came out to save us too. We got lucky there. Paimon probably couldn't have fought them off otherwise.
Oh, so you're a fighter now, Paimon?
Thanks for the rescue, Navia.
Traveler
Oh, so you're a fighter now, Paimon?
Navia
Oh, come now, forget all that polite talk. That wasn't really a farewell meal we had back there — not for me anyway. In truth, I hope that every meal we have together shall be a victory feast.
Navia
As such, we're still partners. There's no need to thank me.
Silver
It will take... fifty years for me to match Demoiselle's magnanimity.
Melus
If it were me, I would have joined the Spina di Rosula on account of her goodwill long ago.
Navia
*sigh* Alright, you two, that's enough...
Paimon
Actually, Navia, how did you know that we were in danger? You sure did show up in the nick of time!
Navia
Well, to be honest, you're the one who tipped us off, Paimon.
Paimon
Huh, really? Paimon contributed somehow? Paimon's even more amazing than she thought!
Navia
Yes, all thanks to you grabbing my drink by mistake.
Paimon
Uh... How did that help...?
Navia
After we parted ways, I was on the way back to one of our bases when I suddenly thought of what you said...
Navia
That the Fonta tasted "kinda salty and icky."
Wait, do you mean that...
I thought it tasted strange as well, but I couldn't be sure.
Traveler
Wait, do you mean that...
Navia
Fonta only comes in sweet flavors, so how could it have tasted salty? The color of the drink, if I recall, had also been a bit off...
Paimon
So the Fonta had been spiked with Water from the Primordial Sea?
Navia
Yes. So, if you hadn't drunk that cup for me...
Melus
Spina di Rosula is preparing the grandest of awards for you as we speak for saving the Boss.
Paimon
Huh, really!?
Fortunately, Paimon, neither of us are from Fontaine...
Otherwise, we would've been...
Traveler
Fortunately, Paimon, neither of us are from Fontaine...
Navia
I sent people to Hotel Debord to investigate, but whoever did this left no trace at all.
Navia
That's when I figured out that you might be in danger, and hurried here as quickly as I could.
Paimon
But why would they go after us too? All we did was defend Lyney in court and help clear his name. Ugh, now we're caught up in this mess too, aren't we?
Navia
Well, you did foil a plan that they were probably pretty proud of, and almost got their name in the process.
Navia
Speaking of which, did anything strange happen when you drank the Primordial Seawater?
Paimon
Well, it can't be a coincidence that Traveler fainted just now. He said that he heard that voice calling for "Vacher" again...
Paimon
Oh, and this time Paimon heard it too, but it was real faint. Does this situation have to do with the Primordial Seawater, then?
According to Lynette...
The ability to hear voices like that has to do with one's sensitivity to the Hydro element.
Traveler
According to Lynette...
Paimon
Does that mean the Primordial Seawater raises someone's sensitivity to Hydro when it's used on people who are not from Fontaine?
Navia
That doesn't sound like too much of a bad thing, to be honest.
Traveler
I also gained some new intel.
Paimon
New intel? While you were out cold?
Navia
Well, let's hear it, shall we?
The voice in the fountain belonged to one of the missing women.
A person named "Vacher" was a witness when she dissolved.
Traveler
The voice in the fountain belonged to one of the missing women.
Navia
Oh? That is important.
???
You tell everyone about what happened while you were connected to the Oceanid's consciousness.
Navia
Vacher... That name doesn't ring a bell. I suppose he hasn't stepped forward as a witness in court lately.
Navia
Since he saw that young woman dissolve, he was at least at the crime scene.
Navia
But he never gave testimony or any information regarding people dissolving in the Primordial Seawater. Could he have been threatened...?
If he's still alive...
We should try searching for him.
Traveler
If he's still alive...
Navia
Yes, thank you. This is very important information indeed. We will continue to investigate.
Alright, partner.
By "we," you mean us too, right?
Traveler
Alright, partner.
Navia
Oh!? You mean... You'll help us investigate?
Paimon
Well, you did say that our farewell meal didn't really count. That means we're still partners, right?
Paimon
And besides, we're in this now whether we like it or not. You're not gonna let these people who targeted us get off the hook so easily, are you, Traveler?
Messing with us will cost them.
This will prove to be their biggest mistake.
Traveler
Messing with us will cost them.
Melus
Demoiselle, do try not to look quite so pleased. You are the face of Spina di Rosula, after all.
Navia
Ahem! You talk too much. Well, in that case, let's head back to one of our bases, shall we? I'll arrange accommodations for you.
Navia
We also have some plans to go over, and hopefully we can deepen our bonds as partners... But we'll take that one step at a time, I guess.
Silver
Don't worry, you two. With us around, our base is definitely secure.
Go to the Spina di Rosula stronghold
Navia
It's right up ahead, but... Let's make sure we weren't followed first.
Silver
I've been keeping watch, Demoiselle. I haven't spotted anyone suspicious thus far.
Navia
Very good, but let's not let our guard down for now.
Melus
I shall find rooms for our respected guests.
Navia
Thank you, Melus. Now, let's continue, Traveler.
Go to the accommodations Navia arranged
Talk to Melus
Paimon
So, uh, this is your base? It's not quite what Paimon imagined...
Melus
Your accommodations have been arranged. Under the present circumstances, I can confidently say it's the best we have.
Thank you...
(Well, so much for my expectations.)
Traveler
Thank you...
Navia
Heh, well, our funds have been a little tight lately...
Navia
After all, we don't allow illegal or unethical profiteering. In fact, our funds often come from the citizenry who support us.
Paimon
Seems like it's tough times for everyone... But if you have the support of the people, that does sound like it's worth it.
Navia
To be honest, our financial situation was a lot better back when my father was in charge a few years ago. I'm afraid I'm not quite his equal...
Paimon
Your father... He was the previous boss of Spina di Rosula, right? How did he...
Melus
Demoiselle, if you'll allow me to explain...
Navia
No, I'll explain it myself. I suppose I couldn't run from this topic forever, and as partners, this is something I hope they can understand.
Navia
My father's name is Callas. Yes, the same one they call "Callas the Unfaithful" in the streets.
Navia
Three years ago, he was accused of murdering his own friend, but he chose a duel to defend his honor instead of standing trial. He died in the Duelists' Ring.
Paimon
Oh no...
Navia
But I do not believe my father was a murderer. I'm sure he was set up...
Navia
At the time, I believed that if he only stood trial and was duly investigated, something amiss would crop up and prove his innocence.
Navia
But strangely, he not only requested the duel himself, but rumor has it...
Navia
...That even after being seriously injured, to the point where he could be deemed as having lost the duel, he refused to surrender, determined to die in the arena.
Navia
Three years later, I still don't understand why he did that...
Navia
How could he protect his honor if he's dead? If anything he gave up his chance to defend himself.
It does seem quite odd.
Do you have any clues as to why?
Traveler
It does seem quite odd.
Navia
The closest piece of info I have is that my father had been investigating the serial disappearances case at the time of his death.
Paimon
Ah, so that's why you're so determined to get to the bottom of that case!
Navia
That's right. I've also tried to investigate the murder my father was implicated in, but I haven't found a single new clue in my countless reviews of the investigation records.
Navia
However, I believe that if the murder case is related to those behind the disappearances, they must know something.
Navia
I must know what really happened. Was my father coerced? Framed? Even if he really did kill his friend, I must get to the truth.
Navia
*sigh* If only he'd been more open with me when he was still alive.
Navia
He even hid the fact that my mother died due to complications when giving birth to me...
Navia
And now here I am, investigating his death. You really are a handful, aren't you, Papa?
Seeking the truth...
For the sake of your family...
Traveler
Seeking the truth...
Traveler
You know, we're quite alike in this regard.
Silver
Demoiselle, please... If there is anything I can do, anything at all...
Melus
I also will never believe that Master Callas murdered anyone. There are none whom I respect more than the two of you, Demoiselle.
Melus
Master Callas did so much good in life... yet all it took was one murder case for him to be dubbed Callas the Unfaithful...
Melus
Even our supporters decreased greatly due to that incident, hence our strained finances at present.
Paimon
Wait. If Callas was such a good man, wouldn't people at least be a little suspicious when he was accused?
Navia
No, perhaps people just revel in that kind of "drama." It's not something exclusive to people from Fontaine, really. Everyone's like that.
Navia
People love watching the evil turn over a new leaf, but they also enjoy watching good people fall into an abyss from one slip-up just as much.
Paimon
But how could... Never mind. If Callas was really falsely accused, we have to find the truth. He didn't deserve to have that happen to him!
Melus
There is one other thing. Master Callas' opponent in the duel... was Ms. Clorinde.
Paimon
Oh. Her? Well then, isn't that as good as saying that she was the one who killed him?
Traveler
No wonder the mood was a little strange between the two of you...
Paimon
Yeah, that's not the sort of thing you can just let go and move on from...
Melus
Ms. Clorinde has always placed great emphasis on the honorable nature of the duel. If her opponent doesn't yield, she will not stop, either.
Melus
She knew Master Callas beforehand, and greatly respected him, but seeing how he was resolute in the arena...
Melus
There was only ever one choice she could have made...
Navia
It's not that I don't understand her at all, but I... I just can't deal with this yet.
Paimon
Don't worry, Navia! Paimon knows how you feel — you don't have to force yourself to do that.
Melus
Afterward, Ms. Clorinde told us that at the start of the duel, Master Callas requested that she ensure Demoiselle Navia's safety.
Then that indicates...
That he intended to die in that duel.
Traveler
Then that indicates...
Melus
Yes, that is our understanding as well.
Navia
*sigh* Oh Papa, what madness drove you to ask the person who killed you to take care of me...
Navia
Alright, anyway... that's the information I wanted to share with you — even if it did sound like I was just complaining towards the end.
No, it's alright.
I understand how important this is to you.
Traveler
No, it's alright.
Navia
Thanks. You two should go and rest. This was quite a day, after all.
Paimon
Yeah. Paimon's beat...
Silver
Please, relax and get some sleep. We will ensure you rest soundly.
Rest in your room
???
A peaceful night passes under the Spina di Rosula's protection...
Paimon
*yawn* Paimon slept so well! This place feels almost too safe...
Paimon
Huh? Navia? Where did the other two go?
Navia
I sent them back to Poisson, it's Spina di Rosula's place of origin and where we have our headquarters. There's not much for them to do here at the moment.
Paimon
Paimon gets the feeling that you're just trying to get them off your back...
Paimon
But never mind that, when did you get back? Were you waiting here the whole time?
Navia
No, I just returned after going out for a while. I did some investigating yesterday regarding the name "Vacher."
Paimon
Wait, so you didn't sleep at all!?
Navia
How could I after having such critical new evidence appear?
Paimon
Uh, guess Paimon wasn't speaking for everyone just now, huh...
Navia
Unfortunately, this name seems to have been wiped from existence. It doesn't seem to have a match anywhere.
Navia
I suspect that those behind this have already taken steps to hinder an investigation from this angle — but that does prove that this Vacher person is a key witness in the incident.
Paimon
Does that mean we're too late, though?
Navia
No, there is one ray of hope, one place in Fontaine that they would find almost impossible to threaten, no matter how much they wanted to.
Navia
And that is the archives kept by Chief Justice Neuvillette. A place where detailed files on all the cases in recent years are kept.
Navia
If the... Oceanid you met is one of the young women who went missing recently, we should be able to find some related information there.
Paimon
So Neuvillette maintains an archive of case files? Guess that's the hardworking Chief Justice for you...
Paimon
In that case, let's go talk to him, shall we?
Navia
...
Paimon
Hmm? Aren't you coming along, Navia? Did you get tired?
Navia
*sigh* No, it's nothing. Let's go see the honorable Chief Justice.

1). Started:
Talk to Melus on the ship
Melus
Boss also didn't tell you that he had been diagnosed with a rare illness. The doctors told him that he had no more than five years left to live...
Melus
And the serial disappearances case caused him great anxiety.
Melus
Five years was nowhere near enough time to resolve this long-standing conflict, but once he passed away, all the danger would pass onto you.
Melus
Knowing all of this, he decided to use one final intimidation tactic before his death. He claimed to have already gotten his hands on some key incriminating evidence for the other side, and even told some members of Spina di Rosula about the details.
Melus
But as long as you remained safe, he would not share the evidence with the public.
Melus
If something were to happen to you, then he and all those he had told would immediately expose all they know about Sinthe and the disappeared victims.
Paimon
Right, so nobody would be able to get off scot-free...
Melus
As we've seen, Boss' tactic has worked. Even though Boss has been gone for a long time, the other side has not tried to take Demoiselle's life.
Navia
No, I don't believe it! He never appeared to look sick to me!
Melus
No father wants their daughter to see them weak and haggard, especially someone as proud as Boss.
Melus
To him, dying in a duel and suffering lasting dishonor as "the Unfaithful" were still far preferable than losing face in front of his daughter.
Navia
Argh!
Navia
...So he chose to die in silence so that he could protect me?
Melus
I'm afraid you're not understanding this correctly, Demoiselle. What Boss wanted to hand to you was not a parasol, but a sword.
Melus
If Boss' spirit could hear you telling me that you want to find the answer for the sake of everyone involved...
Melus
I'm sure he'd be extremely proud.
Navia
That fool, couldn't he have just given it to me straight...
Navia
No, he might have set up everything precisely because... he never thought I'd be able to understand him...
Navia
Is that the amount of confidence he had in me? And what if I was never able to make it to where I am now...?
Traveler
He gave you the choice to live how you want.
Navia
Yeah, I suppose that's true... With the way he'd set things up, if I had wanted, I could have just lived out my life without a care in the world.
Navia
But thankfully, he rarely talked to me about complex matters, and thus understood little of me as a person. In this case... he really didn't need to give me an easy way out.
Navia
Melus, what was the key evidence that he shared with you?
Melus
It's the location where Sinthe is produced. Essentially, it's the enemy's headquarters.
Melus
When he was threatening the enemy, Boss didn't share the specifics of the incriminating evidence he found.
Melus
But if you want to use it against the enemy, you'll still have to take several things into consideration.
Paimon
Why? If we know where the place is, can't we just go storming in?
Melus
You mustn't forget that we're fighting against a mysterious and dangerous organization that's been in operation for decades.
Melus
There's no telling what might be lying in wait at their headquarters. We also have no idea what kind of evidence we may be able to find inside, nor what people we may be able to capture.
Melus
But a single visit to their headquarters would be tantamount to a formal declaration of war.
Melus
The worst case would be that we leave empty-handed, but also open ourselves up to full retaliation.
Paimon
Then in that case, why not work with the Fontaine authorities?
Melus
Well, you saw one of them dissolve during Mr. Lyney's case. We have no idea just how thoroughly they may have been infiltrated.
Navia
That's true... Seems my father really had no choice...
Navia
But things are different now. It should be a lot easier to prove the other side's guilt now that we've connected Sinthe with the disappearances case.
Paimon
You sound like you've put a lot of thought into this, Melus!
Melus
I am the butler, after all. I live but to serve the Boss and Demoiselle's will.
Melus
I've always been willing to take on any kind of risk for your sake, but considering my relative lack of ability, I've spent my time keeping secrets, performing basic investigations, and waiting for the right time to come.
Navia
Thank you for all of that, Melus. Have you discovered anything new in the past few years?
Melus
Let me think... One conclusion I came to was that the enemy must be quite familiar with Spina di Rosula, or at least, have an informant planted here.
Melus
When I announced orders to the organization's members on Demoiselle's behalf, I used to deliberately keep a few people in the dark, and observe the reactions of the Sinthe vendors.
Melus
If the vendors didn't change their plans, then the individuals informed of our orders must be innocent. If the vendors packed up and fled, however, then someone must have given them the news.
Melus
After several rounds of testing and investigative tracing, I've narrowed the suspect list down to three people.
Melus
The first is Florent, Spina di Rosula's senior adviser.
Navia
Huh? Florent?
Melus
Yes. Surprising, isn't it? He was one of the people Boss trusted the most, which also means that he was someone who understood Boss really well.
Melus
Thanks to his position within Boss' innermost circle, he always knew our upcoming plans, and could thus avoid capture this whole time.
Melus
There's someone else like him, too. Marcel, the head of Confrerie of Cabriere.
Navia
Uncle Marcel...
Traveler
What is this "Confrerie"?
Melus
It's a guild in Poisson. Boss helped it to grow to its current size and prominence.
Melus
In the beginning, they were only reselling some daily goods, but now, they're one of the richest guilds around with a lot of business connections in the city.
Paimon
So, they're like a sister organization of Spina di Rosula?
Navia
Yes, you can say that. When we were fighting against the Sinthe dealers, they provided us with plenty of support.
Navia
It's a bit difficult to imagine someone using their own money to hunt down themselves...
Melus
The final suspect is Thierry, the man responsible for coordinating information between Spina di Rosula and the Gardes.
Melus
Although the Gardes mostly leave us to our own devices, there are still many activities we have to report to the local authorities.
Melus
Since Thierry is always in the know about our current activities, he could theoretically always plan one step ahead.
Navia
I see... These are all people who I communicate with quite regularly.
Navia
To think that the enemy we've been fighting against has been right next to me all along, among those I trust the most... It's almost too hard to believe...
Melus
If you want to investigate them, please take every precaution to not alert the quarry. Judging from our experience, the enemy is extremely cautious.
Navia
Of course, and thank you, Melus. You've provided us with a lot of great information.
Melus
You're too kind, my lady. I'm just doing my duty.
Melus
Ah, and before I forget, proving Boss' innocence would also mean clearing him of blame in Jacques' death...
Melus
After that incident, Jacques' wife and daughter were taken into the Spina's care. They still live in Poisson today.
Melus
If it might help, you could also pay them a visit. I can make the necessary arrangements.
Paimon
Aw, thank you so much, Melus! You really are the best!
Navia
A new case awaits, my dear partner.
Traveler
Leave it to me.
Navia
I hope we can work together to uncover the truth, and end this case once and for all.
Go to the Chief Justice's office
Sedene
Halt! Please state your business here. The Chief Justice is presently occupied with official matters.
Paimon
Huh... This place does look pretty heavily guarded. Guess that proves that Neuvillette's files are really secure!
Navia
Hey, don't you recognize us?
Sedene
Huh? Who are you? Just to be clear, I don't care who you are or who you might be related to, our rules make no exceptions.
Navia
See? They've got great discipline, too.
Paimon
Yep yep, Paimon can tell!
Sedene
...If you're just here to crack jokes, I can point you towards the exit. Unlike some, we're busy, so please leave if you don't have a reason to be here.
Navia
No, no, what I meant to say is, shouldn't you remember us from a few days ago? We were at the trial of the Great Magician Lyney.
Sedene
Ohhhh! Yes, I remember, I read about it in The Steambird. You... You must be Lyney's attorneys. It's all coming back to me now.
Navia
We're here today to report and archive some information on a follow-up case.
Sedene
Huh? Is that even a thing...
Navia
Of course! Don't worry, we're here on official business. You can trust us.
Sedene
Alright, then I'll let you through. The Chief Justice is just inside.
Navia
Thanks so much!
Go to the Chief Justice's office
Talk to Neuvillette
Paimon
Um... Sorry to barge in, Monsieur Neuvillette. We only lied to get in because we didn't know any other way...
Neuvillette
It's alright. Please let me know how I may be of assistance to you.
Paimon
Uhh, so you're not mad at us?
Navia
We're looking for a man called "Vacher." He may have been an eyewitness in the serial disappearances case. If we can find him, we may be able to unearth some key information on the case.
Neuvillette
Ah, I see. In that case, please wait here a moment while I browse through the files.
Paimon
Who knew that Neuvillette would be so easy to talk to...
Neuvillette
Unfortunately...
Neuvillette
I'm quite certain that no one by the name of "Vacher" has been involved in any case, criminal or civil, in the past several years.
Neuvillette
There are no records of him either in the files or in my memory.
Guess that's that...
So we're back to square one...
Traveler
Guess that's that...
Paimon
Traveler, what if it was really all just a dream?
Navia
Is that so... Alright then, thank you so much, Monsieur Neuvillette. We'll take our leave now.
Neuvillette
Ahem...
Neuvillette
...Miss Navia, I can understand how you feel.
Neuvillette
Your father, Callas, was a truly exceptional man. We deeply regret his passing.
Navia
...
Navia
And what are you trying to say, Monsieur Neuvillette?
Navia
Are you trying to console me? Extend your sympathy? Or just express some tendril of regret...
Navia
No... You are not trying to do any of that. I can hear it in your voice. There's no emotion behind your words — you only said those things because you felt like you should.
Neuvillette
...
Navia
It's just like last time. After my father took his place in the Duelists' Ring, I pushed through the guards to talk to you as a last resort...
Navia
You even told me then that you thought there was something fishy with the case, yet you still allowed the duel to go ahead.
Navia
In your eyes, the value of a human life is nothing compared to those cold laws you hold so dear.
Navia
If you truly regret my father's death, then why didn't you call a stop to the duel!?
Navia
Why didn't you... give me the power to stop him from throwing his life away, why did you just let him die, despised and hated by all...
Navia
Everything was hanging on a thread at that moment... Just the tiniest effort could have changed everything.
Navia
There are still so many things I never got to tell him... So many questions he still owes me answers to...
Navia
If you really have no heart, then just look me in the eyes — I, Navia, will show you the true meaning of "regret"!
Neuvillette
...
Neuvillette
...I'm sorry, Miss Navia.
Navia
You and my father are truly alike. You'd keep all kinds of things in your heart, and never say a word to anyone.
Navia
It's not so much that you can't feel, but that you would never express anything.
Navia
Oh well... In any case, everyone already knows full well the apathy of the Chief Justice.
Navia
My apologies for taking my emotions out on you, Monsieur Chief Justice. Let's go, Traveler and Paimon.
Leave the Palais Mermonia
Paimon
Navia... Are you okay?
Navia
I'm fine...
Navia
Ah... rain... It's raining.
Paimon
You're right... Wasn't it still sunny when we went into the building? And there shouldn't be any active trials today, how strange...
Navia
Now that I think of it... On the day my father was convicted of murder, it was also raining.
Traveler
Rain...
Paimon
What is it, Traveler? Did you think of something?
Your father's case...
Was he outside when it happened?
Traveler
Your father's case...
Navia
Yeah, he was outside... It was uncovered and the rain could fall there. Why? Do you think the rain could have affected the crime scene?
Navia
That thought has occurred to us before. We've even expanded the search area to try to account for that, but didn't find anything of value.
Traveler
But there was something you didn't know at the time.
Navia
Oh? Wait, you don't mean...!
Traveler
The fact that people can be turned into water.
Paimon
So you're saying that the true murderer could have been turned into water? And then got washed away with the rain...
Paimon
Yeah... And if that's what had happened, then no one would have believed your dad even if he explained what he saw to the authorities!
Navia
I really think I've found a true genius for a partner... You're completely right, how did I not connect the dots earlier...
Navia
Alright, let's go to Poisson! With this new lead in mind, we'll get to the bottom of my father's case for sure!
Paimon
Yeah! We're gonna make progress for sure this time!
Navia
Do you want to go with me now, or do you want to head over by yourself later?
We should go while the idea's still fresh!
You can go first, I'll join you later.
Traveler
We should go while the idea's still fresh!
Navia
Great. Let's go, then.
Go to Poisson
Talk to Navia
Paimon
Woah, what a huge ship! Why would a ship be anchored at a place like this?
Navia
Hehe, there's no need to be so surprised. While it may look like a ship, it's actually Spina di Rosula's headquarters.
Navia
My father was the one who asked for it to be built like this. Perhaps our taste in exterior design is the only thing we occasionally had in common.
Navia
A gigantic and glamorous ship embodies discovery, opportunity, ambition, and conquest. It symbolizes Spina di Rosula's bright and limitless future.
Traveler
I think I'm starting to get why you like it.
Paimon
And Paimon thought you were bluffing when you said Spina di Rosula had a glorious past!
Paimon
Paimon was confused why a group with such a history would live in the sewers...
Paimon
But now that Paimon has seen this ship for herself, she's been convinced!
Navia
Well, Poisson is where Spina di Rosula began, after all. It's our main base, our home.
Talk to Melus on the ship
Visit Jacques' family
Melus
It is settled, then. Please excuse me, and enjoy your conversation at your leisure.
Navia
Thank you for arranging everything for us, Melus.
Coralie
Excuse me, Miss... Do you need anything from us?
Adele
...
Navia
Huh!?
Paimon
Hey, Navia's all quiet... This isn't like her at all.
Traveler
Let's not bother her for now.
Navia
I'm sorry that I only came to visit after all this time. After what happened... I didn't know how I was supposed to face the two of you.
Coralie
Ah, if it's about that, there's no need to apologize. After my husband died, Spina di Rosula sent us a lot of Mora and support. I understood your guilt and apology to be genuine.
Navia
But aren't all of those things nothing compared to the loss of Jacques?
Navia
I can understand the kind of pain that comes with losing a father so needlessly.
Adele
...You don't understand at all.
Navia
I didn't know how to face you because I didn't know what I could possibly bring as a consolation gift.
Navia
I know only the full truth could bring closure to you — and to all of us.
Adele
Mhm...
Coralie
I'm sorry... I appreciate the sentiment, but you don't have to carry all that guilt.
Coralie
On the matter regarding my husband, my daughter and I have more or less found our answer already...
Navia
Would you mind sharing it with me? I really can't believe that my father could ever bring himself to shoot Jacques.
Coralie
I always knew that my husband's money was earned through others' suffering. He told me countless times that if he could turn back the clock, he would never go into the Sinthe business again.
Coralie
He had many regrets, and felt that he took the idea of providing for his family too literally. For the longest time, he thought Mora was everything.
Coralie
So when Mr. Callas came to him with a proposal, he accepted it almost immediately.
Coralie
He tried to be as careful as he could, but even so, he was still found out by the higher-ups...
Navia
They found out about his betrayal?
Adele
Papa didn't say that exactly, but Papa did tell me that I should never be ungrateful.
Coralie
Before he left that day, he told me that he had no choice. It was only later that I realized it was his final farewell to the two of us.
Wait, does that mean...
Someone ordered Jacques to take out Callas?
Traveler
Wait, does that mean...
Coralie
I don't know that for sure, but you could say that's... the conclusion I eventually came to.
Coralie
Which is why I'm the one who should feel guilty. Callas had always taken great care of us, both when he was still alive, and after he passed away...
Coralie
Even if he fired the shot that killed my husband, it was likely in self-defense. It is impossible for me to hate him for what he had done.
Adele
But Mama, why is Papa still the bad guy if he did the right thing?
Adele
Papa always wanted to be a good man, so why did he have to do a bad thing in the end?
Navia
Well, things aren't always as they seem. You still feel like your Papa was a good man, right?
Adele
Yeah, Papa was a really good man. The best in the whole world...
Navia
Then you should hold onto that. If a good man had to do a bad thing, then he must have had his reasons.
Navia
Regardless of whether he left you a parasol or a sword, he must have done so to give you a better life.
Adele
Oh...
Navia
Thank you for everything you've told me. I will definitely find the truth. The current state of things is not something I'm willing to just sit back and accept.
Coralie
Thank you. I'm very grateful to hear this from you.
Coralie
Even though your personality is quite different from your father's, your determination when you speak is really similar...
Navia
...You really think so?
Navia
That's the first time anyone's said that to me.
Talk to Florent
Florent
Greetings, Boss. How may I be of assistance today?
Navia
I'm sure you've heard about what happened at the opera house? Someone got turned into water right in front of us...
Florent
Yeah, I've heard... With something that dramatic, I'm sure journalists will milk it for all its worth, and it'll be all the talk for the next several weeks.
Navia
It also reminded me... On the day that the incident happened with my father, it was raining outside, and we found some clothes left at the scene...
Navia
After my partner here put the dots together for me, I feel like we should try to reopen his case.
Navia
Can you do me a favor and try to recall what happened that night?
Florent
Hmm, let me think... Mr. Callas was feeling pretty upbeat that day, so he was drinking and bantering away with us at the table.
Florent
After that, he told us that he wanted to go get some fresh air, so we let him go without thinking much of it. Who knew that we would hear two gunshots ring out right after...
Florent
My first reaction was that Mr. Callas' life was in danger, so I grabbed my holster and made a mad dash towards the scene.
Florent
But when I got there, it was already too late. Mr. Callas was standing over a dead body with a gun in his hands. All we could do was look back and forth at each other, not knowing what to say...
Navia
So you also remember two gunshots, then?
Florent
Indeed. The Gardes said the first shot didn't hit anyone, while the second killed Jacques... but I've never really bought that explanation.
Florent
Reason being, Mr. Callas had left his gun on the table. I even made sure to confirm that before running to the scene.
Florent
But according to the Gardes, that doesn't mean he couldn't have had other guns on his person.
Florent
About the clothes left at the scene that you mentioned... Do you think there was a third person there who was turned into water?
Traveler
It's very possible.
Navia
At least from our perspective, my father had no reason to kill, so he would also have no reason to bring an extra gun with him.
Navia
The gun he was holding probably belonged to Jacques, or a third person on the scene.
Florent
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So you're saying... Mr. Callas ended up with the gun because he seized it from one of the other guys?
Florent
But hold on, if that's what had happened, then why didn't he share the truth with any of us?
Florent
He didn't even want to face the Oratrice Machine, and chose instead to prove his honor in a duel...
Florent
Did he lose all faith in the courts after seeing someone dissolve right in front of his eyes?
Navia
About that... Melus told me a thing or two, so I think I can understand why he committed to the duel.
Navia
I'll tell you everything once the whole truth has been revealed.
Florent
I understand. Then, I'll leave Mr. Callas' honor in your hands, Boss.
Florent
And if I may just say one more thing... The whole "Callas the Unfaithful" epithet has been a thorn in my side since the day it was invented.
Florent
Many people have laughed at me for still calling him "Mr. Callas" even after so many years have passed.
Florent
But it was Mr. Callas' trust that allowed me to rise through the ranks of Spina di Rosula and live the life I lead today.
Florent
No matter what others might say, he'll always be the man I respect the most, and he'll always be my Boss.
Navia
Don't worry, I will definitely find the truth.
Navia
You and all our other comrades at the Spina deserve to know the truth as well.
Go to the Court of Fontaine and speak to Thierry
Navia
Hey, Thierry. It's me.
Thierry
Oho, now what brings you here, Miss Navia? I've heard that you made quite the name for yourself at the opera house.
Navia
Haha, so you've caught news of that already?
Thierry
Oh, okay... Hey, I'm also a member of the Gardes, you know. The way you make it sound, people would think I was sent off to Poisson because I had done something wrong.
Navia
Are you sure there isn't a little bit of truth in that? Under normal circumstances, shouldn't you have been called back to the city already?
Thierry
Haha, I mean, where I work is really up to me. Let's just say I enjoy the ambience of Poisson.
Thierry
Callas did a fantastic job running the town, building Spina di Rosula from the ground up, and clearing many obstructions in my way.
Thierry
It would be next to impossible for me to find a similarly easy but high-paying job in the city.
Thierry
Anyway, enough chitchat, are these two friends of yours? You here for some formal business?
Navia
Ah yes, these two are my partners.
Navia
What happened at the opera house made us realize that Lyney's case and my father's may be related. We're trying to re-investigate the details of my father's old case.
Thierry
Ah, I get it. You think there might be more to the case now that we know people can be dissolved into water, right? I was also flabbergasted when I first heard of it.
Thierry
If you want to go through the original files from your father's case, I can help you look for them.
Navia
That'd be much appreciated, thank you. Actually, I have another question — do you have the authority to dispatch Gardemeks?
Thierry
Of course! Without them, I couldn't possibly handle Poisson on my own.
Thierry
Why do you ask? We definitely can't use them to forcefully get more evidence for your father's case.
Navia
Well, you see, just recently we were attacked by a horde of unnumbered Gardemeks in the city.
Navia
So if you hypothetically wanted to do something against me, all you would need to do is get rid of the meka's serial numbers and send them after me...
Thierry
Hahaha, then you think too highly of my abilities. "Dispatching" meka is very different from "controlling" them.
Thierry
If I had to make an analogy... when you order a dish, the chef will make it for you. You can ask the chef to cook, but not to massage your shoulders, or carry your baggage.
Thierry
If you try to make unreasonable demands, the chef would just think you're out of your mind and ignore you completely. The same goes for me and my Gardemeks.
Thierry
Removing a serial number is also not as easy as you might think. There are a lot of complex steps to it, and it's almost impossible to keep it a secret.
Thierry
So I can promise you — those meka were definitely private units.
Thierry
They're certainly not cheap, so whoever their owner is must be super rich, powerful, or both. Now that you mention it, though, being in the Sinthe business would definitely be profitable enough to afford this...
Traveler
Makes sense.
Navia
Haha, then you're officially in the clear, Thierry.
Thierry
Ahaha, thank you for the vote of confidence, Navia.
Thierry
Jokes aside, I'd like to wish you all the best with your investigation.
Thierry
I'll be staying in the city for a little while, so just come find me if you need any support from the Gardes.
Contact Marcel
Calcagni
Hello, how may I help you?
Navia
I'm here to see Marcel. Could you please let him know? You can just say Navia is looking for him.
Calcagni
Sure, I will let him know right away.
???
After waiting for a while, Marcel arrives in a hurry.
Marcel
Navia, hello! Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm not as young as I used to be, so my legs are giving out a bit.
Navia
It's alright, Uncle Marcel. There's no need to stress.
Navia
I just wanted to talk to you briefly about what happened in the opera house. I'm sure you saw everything too, right?
Marcel
Yes, I've never seen anything so strange.
Paimon
Oh, you were at the opera house, too?
Marcel
That's right, I went there with Navia to see the magic show. Who knew it would turn into a whole murder mystery...
Marcel
I also witnessed your marvelous sleuthing work. Quite impressive.
Marcel
To beat the Hydro Archon at her own game on her home turf... I can already imagine everyone in Fontaine discussing your exploits over a few glasses of wine.
Paimon
Oh, Paimon doesn't want to become the talk of drunkards...
Marcel
Hahaha, apologies, it's just how Fontaine is as a nation. Everyone loves drama and theatrics.
Navia
Uncle Marcel, you've also noticed that other thing, right? The fact that humans can dissolve in water...
Marcel
Yes, I was reminded of your father's case right away. Is that what you're investigating now?
Navia
Exactly. I still don't have much solid proof, but I can sense that the other side has already begun to act.
Marcel
Oh, and what makes you say that?
Navia
We were attacked on Erinnyes by some unnumbered Gardemeks, and there was also an attempt to get me to drink Water from the Primordial Sea.
Navia
If not for the vigilance of my partner, I probably wouldn't even be here talking to you right now.
Paimon
You're giving us too much credit! Wasn't it you who protected us?
Marcel
Alas, it seems things are heating up again. The peace that Callas sought so dearly will soon become a thing of the past.
Marcel
But rest assured, Navia, Poisson will always remain a safe haven for you. If you're scared, you can always return there.
Marcel
If anyone dares to lay their hands on you there, the Confrerie of Cabriere will use its funds to the last Mora to bring them to justice.
Navia
Thank you, Uncle Marcel. But I don't intend to go into hiding. I'm going to strike while the iron's hot.
Navia
Do you have any new thoughts on my father's case?
Marcel
Hmm, about that... Sorry, my age's catching up with me, so it'll take me a while to recall my memory.
Marcel
The Confrerie was responsible for that banquet, so I was out and about the whole time making sure things were running smoothly. I didn't even have the time to drink with the guests.
Marcel
Then I heard the sound of a gunshot, and the rest was history.
Navia
It's okay, no need to push yourself. We'll ask around some more, see if there are any valuable clues elsewhere.
Marcel
Sounds good. Just let me know if you ever need Mora.
Marcel
All my wealth comes from Callas' patronage and support. I'll spend however much it takes to clear his name.
Go over the clues with Navia
Navia
You know, if you think everything through, Uncle Marcel is indeed the most suspicious of them all...
Paimon
Could we be missing other suspects? Melus didn't know about the people turning into water thing when he narrowed it down to these three, did he?
Navia
Melus has always been very reliable, and his judgment of others' trustworthiness has been fair and well-considered. When he laid out his case for the three, the rationale he gave me made a lot of sense as well.
Navia
The suspect is knowledgeable about the Spina's internal affairs, has the means to dispatch meka to assassinate us, and possesses significant intellect and foresight...
Navia
Even if I don't want to believe it, I'm starting to see how things could all tie back to Uncle Marcel.
Traveler
He is someone who's very close to you, after all.
Paimon
Well, we still have another trump card on top of all the theorizing and speculating!
Traveler
The Sinthe production base!
Navia
Yes... Melus did say that charging straight in there would be extremely risky, but we don't have any other options right now...
Navia
We'd need far more solid proof before we can hope to go charging in on our enemy.
Thierry
Navia, here you are... *panting*... I've been looking for you.
Paimon
Huh? Aren't you the guy from the Gardes? Did something happen?
Thierry
Yeah, news came from Erinnyes just after you left! We've got another trial on our hands!
Navia
Wasn't that place built specifically for holding trials? What's so newsworthy about this one?
Thierry
I know, I know, but they said the person they're putting on trial is a Fatui Harbinger called Tartaglia!
Traveler
Wait, Childe!?
Navia
What? Is that someone you know?
Paimon
Yeah, we know him, maybe even a little too well...
Thierry
Well, he's been accused of being the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case. It's absurd, don't you think?
Navia
Wait, how? None of our investigations have had anything to do with him.
Thierry
That's what I thought was strange about it... So I came to tell you the news right away.
Thierry
If the charge against him stands, then it'll be next to impossible to get the Gardes to support any of our planned investigations.
Navia
Right, because they'll think they've already found the culprit...
Thierry
Yeah, and it'll be a lot harder then to clear Mr. Callas' name.
Navia
I understand. Well, partner, what do you think we should do? We still haven't found any conclusive evidence...
Paimon
Uh... Erm...
Traveler
Let's split up.
Navia
Hmm, split up? What do you mean?
You can go to Erinnyes, while I'll go investigate "that place."
I'm confident in my combat abilities.
Traveler
You can go to Erinnyes, while I'll go investigate "that place."
Navia
Hahaha, just as expected of my partner!
Navia
Since this is a trial about the serial disappearances case, the culprit's attention will be focused on Erinnyes, leaving his home base wide open...
Navia
You're right, this is our best opportunity. Alright then, let's do this. I'll stall them at the opera house and charge Marcel as the true culprit.
Navia
I won't have any chance of making that charge stick though, unless we find more evidence. It'll be up to you to make it back in time and hand the decisive evidence to me.
Traveler
Leave it to me.
Paimon
We'll help you just like you helped us in Lyney's trial!
Melus
Demoiselle, please allow us to accompany you.
Silver
I'm ready.
Navia
Melus, Silver... when did you two get here!?
Melus
We heard that you'll be leaving Poisson and figured that you might require our assistance.
Melus
It's our hope that your confidence will be bolstered with the two of us by your side.
Navia
Hahaha, thank you so much. Then, let's make haste for Erinnyes! Paimon, Traveler, I'll see you at the opera house!
Paimon
See you then!

Finally found it... So this is the entrance that leads to the Sinthe production base... It sure doesn't seem out of the ordinary at all...
Well, they don't want it to stand out.
Yes, but I'm sure what we find inside will be "extraordinary."
Traveler
Well, they don't want it to stand out.
Paimon
Ah, you're right... An important place like this is bound to have a ton of protective measures and mechanisms.
Paimon
Navia's probably arguing up a storm right now to stall for us...
Go to the opera house to identify the culprit
Canny Audience Member
Ah, so that's what happened...
Surprised Audience Member
Wait, you're telling me something as dangerous as Water from the Primordial Sea has been used for all these years?
Marcel
What a great theory. It also explains Callas' and Jacques' respective motives... I guess they didn't shoot each other after all.
Neuvillette
Mr. Marcel, you are the one being charged with a crime. You should provide a rebuttal if you wish to prove your innocence.
Marcel
But I think I agree with everything Navia just said. In fact, there was nothing in her speech that directly implicated me...
Furina
Th—Then, may I ask some questions? In my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things...
Furina
One, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
Navia
I'm afraid not — at least, not at this very moment.
Scornful Audience Member
Boo! Hahaha, if you don't have any evidence, you should just go home!
Navia
I may not have the evidence with me, but I know where I could go to collect it. If we look up the deserted clothes against a record of people who went missing at around the same time...
Navia
We should be able to find a match.
Navia
Considering the serial disappearances case, the Gardes probably kept careful records of all missing persons from around that time, regardless of age or gender.
Furina
That makes sense to me... Monsieur Neuvillette, I would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
Navia
Why do I feel like Furina's acting a little differently today?
Silver
Maybe she's scared of embarrassing herself again?
Melus
Alternatively, she's become more diligent after charging an innocent citizen in the last trial.
Furina
My second question has to do with the ensuing duel. If the truth is indeed as you described...
Furina
Then why didn't Mr. Callas explain himself in court? If he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
Navia
I've thought about this too, and the answer is actually pretty simple — he felt there were things that were more important to him.
Navia
The dissolving power of Water from the Primordial Sea is an important secret for the true culprit of the serial disappearances case.
Navia
My father could have exposed it for all to see, but he chose to take it to the grave.
Navia
At that time, Spina di Rosula was in dire straits, and his reputation had already been shattered. He had no guarantee that going forward with the truth would allow the culprit to be brought to justice.
Navia
What was certain, however, was that it would paint a gigantic target on my back.
Melus
Boss once told me that Demoiselle had already been selected as the next target of the serial disappearances case.
Furina
What!?
Navia
If the secret had gotten out, the culprit would have fought an all-out war with the Spina right there and then. I wouldn't have been the only one in danger — all of us would have stood to lose our lives.
Navia
Of course, the Gardes might eventually figure out the truth of the matter, and determine that we were in the right...
Navia
But what good would that do? How can a hollow verdict protect anyone?
Navia
Had this opera house ever given my father any kind of confidence in its brand of justice, Spina di Rosula would have had no reason to exist!
Navia
But by staying silent, we retained the ability to deter our opponents, and continue the stalemate.
Navia
I was also able to become Spina di Rosula's president, which made me harder to target, as well as giving me more time to grow and learn.
Navia
And once I have figured out the truth and stepped up to the challenge, I will do what this opera house cannot, and restore my father's truth and honor back to him!
Furina
So... You mean to say... Your father intended to die in the Duelists' Ring?
Navia
That's right.
Furina
Do you have any proof?
Navia
Of course.
Navia
All you need is to ask his opponent, Clorinde.
Clorinde
...
Navia
I don't need your apology, your guilt, or your support from the shadows. You don't have to do anything for my sake.
Navia
But since he entrusted his will to you, Clorinde, you should tell us the truth about his sacrifice.
Furina
Erm... So... During the duel, did you believe that Callas was intending to die?
Clorinde
Yes, I did.
Clorinde
As a Champion Duelist, I've fought many battles, and taken a countless number of dishonored lives.
Clorinde
In my line of work, I've seen all kinds of people give their all for the faintest hope to continue living. Some were determined, others passionate, and some even manic and twisted.
Clorinde
Just one look and I can tell if a duelist is hoping to live, or if they're looking to die.
Clorinde
I hereby swear on my name and honor as a Champion Duelist that Mr. Callas never intended to leave the Ring alive.
Navia
...
Furina
Since that's your testimony, I have no more questions. It appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case...
Neuvillette
I concur. However, Miss Navia, you still have not explained the link between your father's case and the serial disappearances case.
Approving Audience Member
Right? What she said was fascinating, but kind of beside the point...
Astonished Audience Member
Wait, weren't they just talking about the serial disappearances case!?
Navia
Of course, Your Honor. The two cases are connected via a matter of timing.
Navia
In my father's case, the culprit intended to kill both Jacques and Callas. As a result, they planned to act after hearing two gunshots.
Navia
And at the end of Lyney's trial, the culprit also only dissolved the victim in front of everyone because they realized they were at risk of being identified.
Navia
The culprit could only time their actions so precisely if they were already at the scene.
Navia
Coincidentally, Marcel attended both the banquet and the trial.
Marcel
So that's why you suspected me... *sigh* Even after hearing your reasoning, I still can't help but find it a little preposterous.
Marcel
I'm used to it, though. You've always been an impulsive and sentimental child, Navia. It's one of your most endearing traits.
Silver
No need to appeal to pathos.
Marcel
I won't try to refute your points one by one, but even if everything you just said was true, can you prove that I was the only person present at both events?
Marcel
On top of that, does a person have to be physically present to control the timing? Can't someone remotely monitor the place?
Navia
Ah...
Approving Audience Member
Oof, don't know what she can say to that...
Marcel
I know that even with that, you might still think you can reduce the list of suspects with some further investigations, until I'm the only one left on the list.
Marcel
Alas, who won't feel at least a little hurt by an accusation of murder from a girl you see as your own daughter?
Marcel
But if I were to dismiss this completely, you'd also think I'm not being considerate of your feelings. Ah well, let Uncle Marcel teach you another lesson.
Marcel
Do you know what the biggest flaw in your reasoning is?
Navia
I suppose you're going to tell me anyways...
Marcel
It's "timing," again.
Marcel
I'm a businessman by trade. From that standpoint, there's no reason for me to kidnap young women. It's a high-risk action with nothing to gain.
Marcel
In addition, I left my home in Snezhnaya when I was young to come to Poisson and work in some trade. My business only thrived when I received Callas' patronage.
Marcel
But the disappearances began before I ever stepped foot in Fontaine.
Navia
Ah...
Melus
I do apologize, Demoiselle. This was my mistake.
Navia
No, it's not your fault. I'm sure he had come prepared...
Marcel
Is there anything else you'd like to say? Would you like to check the date of my first business license against the first known case of the serial disappearances?
Marcel
You can also take a look at my border entry records, or ask my friends and family when I left Snezhnaya for the first time.
Marcel
Could those records and testimonies do something to appease the unspeakable anguish in your heart?
Sighing Audience Member
Seems like she's got the wrong guy...
Excited Audience Member
At this rate, Navia will be convicted for falsely accusing him.
Marcel
I think you've done a superb job of dissecting your father's feelings as he neared the end of his life.
Marcel
But aren't you going against all of his wishes and expectations right now?
Marcel
He wished for you to become more rational, collected, and conscientious, instead of dwelling only on your own feelings.
Marcel
Once you've learned to be more considerate of others' feelings, and to stop rushing headlong into things, you'd have met most of his expectations.
Navia
This isn't just about me, and it never has been...
Navia
The biggest difference between me and the rest of the victims is that I still have the ability to search for the truth, while that same agency has long been taken from them.
Navia
The people whose families were destroyed by Sinthe abuse, the people who lost their loved ones to the serial disappearances, and the people who suffered tragic ends due to their sense of justice...
Navia
Many people's images are flashing before my eyes. I'm sure some are coming to those of you in the audience as well...
Navia
And whose image do you see, Marcel?
Navia
Is it a man named "Vacher"?
Marcel
...!?
Navia
Oh? So you do know that name.
Marcel
I'm merely surprised you'd suddenly say the name of someone I've never even heard of.
Navia
I was waiting for you to say that.
Enter the headquarters
Proceed deeper within to investigate
Discuss with Paimon
Paimon
Phew... After all that, we finally made it to the innermost sanctum.
Paimon
Though as expected, the mastermind isn't here...
If I'm not mistaken...
He's being charged by Navia as we speak.
Traveler
If I'm not mistaken...
Paimon
Ah, that's right! Then let's hurry up and find some evidence so we can get back to the Opera House and help Navia!
Look for clues in the headquarters' depths
Analyze the clues you've found with Paimon
Paimon
We've looked at almost everything here, and it seems like our theories were spot on! But...
Traveler
Who really is this "Vacher"...?
Paimon
Yeah, we haven't found anything that reveals his true identity...
Paimon
No wonder even Neuvillette wasn't able to find anything... Whoever it is probably destroyed everything to do with that name a long time ago...
Paimon
That way, even if we bring all of this back to the Opera, we won't be able to identify the true culprit.
Clever...
But maybe not clever enough. Let's look again.
Traveler
Clever...
Paimon
Sure thing! Paimon won't admit defeat to this guy either!
Look for clues related to "Vacher"
Race back to the opera house and submit the evidence
Confront Marcel
Traveler
But the truth of it, Marcel, is that you've always been Vacher!
Marcel
Huh!?
Paimon
We've investigated your lair, and we already know everything!
Paimon
After your lover, Vigneire, was dissolved, you kept abducting young women to experiment on in hopes of bringing her back to you!
Paimon
You even created "Marcel" as a new identity, and destroyed all records of your past as Vacher!
Furina
So that's it... Even the villains in opera performances rarely go that far...
Furina
And with that, Marcel's motive has now been established...
Navia
This information regarding your past also dismantles your prior "timing" defense.
Navia
Well, Marcel, do you know where you went wrong?
Marcel
...
Navia
You fixated your gaze on the lover that passed away, instead of paying attention to the living people around you.
Navia
So you never noticed how we changed, or how we grew as individuals.
Melus
You also never understood Boss' real expectations for his daughter.
Silver
Or our determination to see things through.
Marcel
Your... determination... Hah... Hahaha...
Neuvillette
Mr. Marcel, please speak up now if you would like to defend yourself. Otherwise, the trial will move onto the next stage.
Marcel
Do you think... Do you really think I wanted to do any of this?
Marcel
Pay attention to you? What for!? Have you ever paid attention to me? Ever empathized with my pain? Ever known how it feels to watch the love of your life dissolve right in front of your eyes!?
Marcel
No one helped me — no one even believed me. All those decades ago, even the officers from the Maison Gardiennage were laughing at me...
Marcel
They said there's no way a human being can turn into water, so I must have gone mad from grief! Vigneire's death was brushed away by all of you as if it didn't matter at all!
Marcel
Well, now you know, don't you!? Hah, well, it's too late now! All those who were dissolved are gone forever!
Marcel
You only have yourselves to blame! You set up this ornate opera house in pursuit of your so-called justice, your beloved drama, while turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people!
Marcel
Vigneire is dead! We promised each other that we would always be together — wherever she goes, I will follow!
Marcel
But I'm not from this blasted place, so I can't be dissolved, no matter what I do!
Paimon
H—Hey, is that Water from the Primordial Sea that he's drinking!?
Marcel
I can't dissolve, can't dissolve, can't dissolve! Hahahaha...
Marcel
Do you all see? I can't go, I can't follow... So if I can't go where she is, what choice do I have but to try to bring her back?
Marcel
I did all of that, and in the end, that accursed Callas still got the better of me...
Marcel
I spent my entire life living on pins and needles, only to get stabbed by his idiot daughter at the very end, ha, haha, hahahaha!
Neuvillette
The suspect is exhibiting signs of mental distress. Gardes, please restrain him.
Marcel
Don't touch me! Don't anybody come near me, I still need to save Vigneire, our promise, we made a promise...
Marcel
Vigneire, Vigneire...
Marcel
Please Vigneire, don't think badly of me... All I want is to fulfill our promise...
Neuvillette
At this point, the verdict of this trial is clear. With Mr. Marcel's conviction, the charges against Mr. Tartaglia no longer have any basis.
Childe
Fine by me. I was in a bad mood, but after a show like that, I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Neuvillette
Traveler, please submit all the evidence you have collected to the Gardes so that I might review and summarize the truth behind the serial disappearances case.
???
Neuvillette proceeds to review and compile all the evidence and records...
Neuvillette
The man now known as Marcel was originally named Vacher, and worked as an adventurer with his partner and lover, Vigneire.
Neuvillette
During an underwater expedition, Vigneire accidentally came into contact with Water from the Primordial Sea, and was dissolved in front of Vacher as a result.
Neuvillette
Vacher learned of the Primordial Water's existence through the work of others, and began to kidnap young women for research, with the goal of discovering a method to restore Vigneire back to life.
Neuvillette
To cover his tracks, he invented the new alias of "Marcel," and began to operate a business in Poisson.
Neuvillette
During the course of his research, Vacher discovered that a diluted concoction of Water from the Primordial Sea can induce feelings of euphoria, and began to manufacture and market "Sinthe."
Neuvillette
However, as he accumulated wealth to fund his continued research and expanded the scope, he came into conflict with Spina di Rosula.
Neuvillette
After exchanging blows with Spina di Rosula for many years, Vacher decided to assassinate their president, Callas, at a banquet.
Neuvillette
Although the assassination did not go as Vacher expected, he was able to turn Callas into the murder suspect by dissolving the assassin he sent to the scene.
Neuvillette
And just recently, Vacher attempted to frame Lyney as the culprit of the serial disappearances case using a similar method.
Neuvillette
However, his attempt to frame Lyney failed, and the power of Water from the Primordial Sea became public knowledge. This case also exposed enough of Vacher's machinations that he was eventually successfully charged in court.
Neuvillette
Thus concludes the enigmatic history of the serial disappearances case, with the truth revealed to all.
Audience
(Applause)
Neuvillette
The Oratrice will now deliver the final verdict regarding the charges against Mr. Vacher.
Neuvillette
According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Mr. Vacher is—
Neuvillette
—Guilty.
Marcel
...
Furina
Gardes, take Vacher away!
Excited Audience Member
Good! It's what he deserves!
Eager Audience Member
With that, the serial disappearances case is over now...
Emotional Audience Member
We really just witnessed history... Who would have thought the true culprit would be such a polite and well-spoken guy...
Paimon
Yippee!!! We helped Navia bring the bad guy to justice!
Paimon
He's hurt so many innocent people, now he's finally getting what he deserves.
Paimon
Huh? Are you okay?
Traveler
Navia...
Navia
...
Silver
Demoiselle, you were absolutely brilliant.
Melus
The day our late Boss had always hoped for has finally come. You can rest easy now, knowing justice has been served.
Navia
Yeah... Yeah. It's finally over. It's all thanks to you guys, and my partner.
Navia
See, Papa? Spina di Rosula's still doing well with me at the helm...
Childe
Well now, hasn't this been a most delicious piece of drama? The villain has been caught, justice has been served, past wrongs have been righted, and it's a big ol' happy ending...
Childe
Since it's been such a great show, I'll just let the false accusations against me slide. Either way, I've still got some business to attend to, so if you'll excuse me...
Neuvillette
Please wait just one moment, Mr. Tartaglia.
Childe
Oh, what now? None of this has anything to do with me.
Neuvillette
According to court protocol, since this trial was initiated due to a charge against you, a verdict must also be made regarding the initial charge before the trial can conclude.
Childe
Ah c'mon, is this really necessary? Haven't you already caught the real criminal? Isn't it time for side characters like me to exit stage left?
Neuvillette
Please respect the laws of Fontaine. This has always been the rule.
Childe
Alright, alright, but this sure is a lot of hassle. All I need to do is to stand over there, right? Let's just get this over with.
Neuvillette
...Through evidence presented in the public trial that was just held, it has been established that Mr. Tartaglia has no direct connection to the serial disappearances case.
Neuvillette
The guilty party has been identified, and thus, it is logical to suppose Mr. Tartaglia is innocent of the charges.
Neuvillette
We now turn to the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale to render the final verdict on the charges.
Neuvillette
Hmm...
Neuvillette
According to the judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, Mr. Tartaglia is—
Neuvillette
...Guilty.
Paimon
What!?
Childe
Hey, hey! That's not funny... Didn't you just say I'm supposed to be innocent?
Childe
What's with this verdict? Is your justice machine malfunctioning?
Confident Audience Member
Huh!? This has never happened before, the Oratrice... actually returned a different verdict from the Chief Justice...
Contemplative Audience Member
I mean, have you ever heard of an innocent Fatui Harbinger? Do you think the Oratrice might have just convicted him on general principle?
Doubtful Audience Member
But weren't the charges about the serial disappearances case? No matter what else he's guilty of, it shouldn't affect the verdict in this case, right?
Childe has been declared guilty by the Oratrice...
Just what is going on here?
Traveler
Childe has been declared guilty by the Oratrice...
Neuvillette
The judgment of the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale is, by law, the final verdict of the court. We must accept the guilty verdict.
Neuvillette
Gardes, please take the suspect into custody per court protocol.
Learn about the situation from Neuvillette
Paimon
Hey, Monsieur Neuvillette, what's going on? Shouldn't he have been cleared already?
Neuvillette
Apologies, this is also the first time I've encountered such a situation. However, according to the rules established at the conception of Fontaine's court system, the Oratrice's judgment is the final verdict of the court.
Neuvillette
All I do is follow court procedure. As for why the Oratrice arrived at the conclusion it did, you should probably ask someone more knowledgeable than me.
If even the Chief Justice doesn't know...
...Then we have no choice but to ask the Archon herself.
Traveler
If even the Chief Justice doesn't know...
Furina
Ah... Wh—Why are you looking at me? I had nothing to do with it...
Furina
I—I don't know what happened there, either... H—Hey, stop staring at me...
Surprised Audience Member
...What does Lady Furina mean by that?
Contemplative Audience Member
She says she has no idea either? But that's impossible... Didn't she create the Oratrice herself?
Doubtful Audience Member
...Yeah, so are the verdicts reliable or not? Can results like this really be called justice?
Furina
...
Furina
Ahem... My dearest citizens, did you really think we'd allow an incorrect verdict to be handed out in this court? Did you really believe that the judgment could be mistaken, or be the result of some sort of random mishap?
Furina
Don't tell me... you thought even I had been blindsided by the Oratrice's result?
Paimon
Hmm... But the way she looked just now, it was pretty obvious she had no idea what was going on...
Furina
However, given the state of things, I shall give you an explanation. Everything that just took place — including my supposed shock and bafflement — was a part of an elaborate performance, with every action meant to stir up drama and excitement.
Furina
And of course, for every performance, there is a script. Everything has unfolded exactly as I expected from the very beginning. As the embodiment of the very concept of justice, the Oratrice shall never render an arbitrary judgment!
Furina
If you thought Childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence...
Furina
Everything he's done, not to mention the danger he poses, are beyond ordinary comprehension and completely unforgivable!
Furina
All shall be revealed in time! You will come to understand my noble intentions, as well as the absolute correctness of the Oratrice's verdict. Hahahaha...
Furina
...Now, having said that, although I hate to leave things hanging in suspense, it is now time for this performance to end. As the lead actress, I shall be the first to take my leave. Toodle-oo~
Neuvillette
...So she chose to make her escape after all, did she.
Paimon
Er... So you're saying we shouldn't put much stock in what she just said?
Neuvillette
Mm, she probably just put on that performance to save face. As for the truth, it's unlikely that she actually has any idea.
Traveler
Way to pull the rug out from under her...
Neuvillette
However, please be assured that I will continue to investigate this case in a personal capacity. Just as I promised, if the judgment has been incorrect, we will do our utmost to clear his name.
Paimon
Alright... Even though we feel pretty badly for him, we'll take your word for it for now.
Paimon
After all, he's done plenty of bad stuff, so he should have known he'd go to prison someday, right?
Leave the opera house
Esmond
Hey, what are you doing!? Quick, stop him!
Marcel
Traveler! Hey! Traveler!
Paimon
Ahh! Marcel, what are you doing over here?
Esmond
Stop resisting arrest! Cease, or we'll add another charge to the list!
Marcel
No, no, wait! I just wanted to ask Traveler something... I'm not looking to run away, please, please just let me ask this one small thing...
Neuvillette
...Go on.
Marcel
Thank you... Thank you...
Marcel
I was being led away when I finally realized something... Where did you first hear the name "Vacher"?
Marcel
I erased all records of that name... So... Unless...
Esmond
Are you still trying to prove your innocence? Give it up, you've already been convicted.
Yes...
I met "her."
Traveler
Yes...
Marcel
A—Ah... Really? You, you did? You're sure? You met her... But how could that be, how did you manage to do it!?
It was around the Fountain of Lucine...
Something to do with my sensitivity to the Hydro element...
Traveler
It was around the Fountain of Lucine...
Marcel
The Fountain of Lucine!? Then... Then she's been so close to me all along!? And I just never...
Marcel
Please, please give me a chance to talk to her again, just let Traveler take me to the Fountain to see her one last time... This is the last request I'll ever make in my life, you can do whatever you want to me afterwards, I don't care...
Esmond
What, give you an inch, and you wanna take a mile? Do you think serial killers get to make requests like that?
Paimon
Hmph, Paimon agrees! Why should we give him what he wants when he's only done a ton of super terrible things?
Neuvillette
This request, is it worth as much to you as your life?
Marcel
Of course! Wait, no, it's worth even more than my life...
Neuvillette
Humans... will they betray the instinct to live just to satisfy spiritual needs...?
Neuvillette
Very well, I will grant your request.
Esmond
Your Honor, I fear that...
Neuvillette
I will go with him. You do not need to worry about any escape.
Esmond
Ah... In that case, I shall leave him in your most capable hands, Chief Justice.
Marcel
Thank you... Thank you, Your Honor...
Bring Marcel to the fountain plaza
Marcel
Is this the place...? You said she's here, but what do I need to do to see her?
Back then, I drank Water from the Primordial Sea...
It heightened my sensitivity to the Hydro element...
Traveler
Back then, I drank Water from the Primordial Sea...
Paimon
Yeah, and even Paimon could hear her after drinking that thing! Didn't you just drink a lot of it on the stage as well? In that case...
Oceanid?
"Vacher..."
Marcel
!!!
Paimon
Yes, that's it! So you heard it too!
Marcel
Vigneire, it's me! It's me, Vacher!
Oceanid?
"Vacher... Vacher..."
Marcel
I'm here, I'm here... Where are you, Vigneire? I'm coming for you, I'm finally here for you...
Paimon
Hey, wait, be careful, hey, waaaaait!
Talk to "Vigneire"
Marcel
Vigneire... Is that you? It's me, Vacher... Vigneire...!
Oceanid?
Vacher... Why did you come... Didn't I say... You don't need to look for me...
Oceanid?
You... You look a lot older than I remember... How long has it been?
Marcel
It's been... More than twenty years. I've suffered for over twenty years since the day you left...
Marcel
All this time, only the thought of bringing you back has kept me alive... Nothing else mattered to me...
Marcel
Ah, I must be dreaming... Who would have thought I'd get the chance to tell you all of my feelings like this...
Marcel
Vigneire... You are my everything... I really don't know... how I could live without you...
Oceanid?
But Vacher... If you ask me, this world would be better off without you.
Marcel
Wh—What are you saying?
Oceanid?
If not for you, I would have finished my law degree, and probably become a top-tier attorney one day...
Oceanid?
If not for you, I would have continued to pursue my love of the arts, and my works would have been displayed in the Palais Mermonia itself...
Oceanid?
If not for you... I would at least have been able to take care of my mother, and she would not have grown old and died alone, with nothing but the tears on her cheeks...
Oceanid?
It's all because of your selfishness, Vacher, it's all because of you!
Marcel
You... Wait, you are not Vigneire... Who are you!?
Oceanid?
You're right, I'm not Vigneire... I am... the "sacrifices."
Oceanid?
Every woman who died by your hand... as our bodies dissolved, our consciousnesses flowed back to the Primordial Sea.
Oceanid?
Our thoughts circulated endlessly within the Primordial Sea, and we were no longer individuals, but we became one, just as streams of water come together in the sea.
Oceanid?
I'm Crecy, I'm Lemonie, I'm Aisine...
Oceanid?
The only one I am not... is Vigneire.
Marcel
Why... But then, where is Vigneire!?
Oceanid?
She doesn't want to see you anymore... Every tendril of her consciousness is avoiding you.
Oceanid?
This is what you get for your selfishness! Your selfishness robbed us of our lives and our futures. You said time and time again that you'd do any and everything for her...
Oceanid?
But did you ever consider whether she'd want to see you do the things that you did? If she would despise you for what you became?
Marcel
I... I...
Oceanid?
You are a liar, a heartless murderer, and a cowardly narcissist.
Oceanid?
The only thing you're not... is Vigneire's beloved.
Oceanid?
From the moment your first victim died, and her consciousness merged with Vigneire's, she has had nothing but pure hatred for you.
Traveler
(It looks like I didn't meet Vigneire back then either... They must have wanted me to lure Marcel here from the very beginning...)
Marcel
No... Vigneire, she can't hate me... Let me see her, please, have mercy...
Oceanid?
You still don't understand? When I said, don't look for me... That came from the real Vigneire, she really doesn't want to see you anymore...
Oceanid?
But on top of that, she also said that because... it's her final drop of pity for you.
Oceanid?
She said that because she knew... That if you did come here, "we"... will show no mercy to you...
Oceanid?
"Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"... "Vacher"...
Vigneire
"Drown."
Marcel
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh—
Stroll around the Court of Fontaine
Paimon
Finally, we have some time to do shopping! Gosh, it's really been a long time since we've been able to relax...
Shopping is stressful in its own way, though.
My legs are killing me...
Traveler
Shopping is stressful in its own way, though.
Navia
Well met, partner! I knew something great was going to happen when I woke up in such a good mood today.
Melus
Even this weather can't put a damper on the Demoiselle's mood.
Silver
It's a pleasure to see you both again.
Paimon
Oh, hey, Navia! It's been a few days, Paimon's already started to miss you!
Navia
Oho, now that I believe! I'm easy to work with, and always bring home the bacon; who wouldn't treasure having a partner like me?
Paimon
Haha, sounds like you're really enjoying life these days, Navia! What have you been busy with since the trial?
Navia
Ugh, it's just been one thing after the other. I've been making non-stop trips between Poisson and the Court since then...
Navia
Everyone from Spina di Rosula organized a memorial for my father. We never held a memorial when he first died, since everyone knew that even if we held one back then, no one was going to come.
Navia
This time, though, everyone in Poisson and even many people from the Court all attended.
Paimon
Ah, so his name's definitely been cleared now! That's what we like to hear!
Melus
It's been the dearest wish of Demoiselle all along.
Navia
Hahaha... that blasted stubborn fool, I was right to put my faith in him. I'm so glad I didn't give up on the case all those years ago...
Traveler
Things turned out as well as they could have.
Navia
Oh, by the way... I ran into Charlotte just after I left the memorial service.
Navia
Well, maybe it'd be more accurate to say that I knew that she would be there, and there was no way she'd just let me go...
Paimon
Eh!? So you know Charlotte too? The Charlotte... journalist from The Steambird?
Navia
Yeah, way back when I first became the president of the Spina di Rosula, she was all over me, wouldn't take no for an answer...
Navia
I believe the story was called "The True Heart of Darkness: Secret Tales of the Yellow Rose."
Navia
To be fair, though, it was a really flattering feature, hahaha... So we've been on pretty good terms ever since.
Navia
She was trying to lean on our friendship to get me to do an exclusive piece on the serial disappearances case.
Paimon
Oh, yeah, she told us about that... She's always been super interested in that case, so now, her wish has finally come true too!
Navia
Anyway, I told her to make sure that when she writes about you guys entering the Opera House with the critical evidence that you both sound really cool.
Paimon
Hehe, now that's another thing to look forward to! We trust Charlotte's skills with a pen for sure!
Navia
Oh, and in other news, I also took Clorinde out for a meal.
Paimon
Oh? Are you two on better terms now?
Navia
Hmm... While you were investigating Vacher's headquarters, Clorinde gave testimony on my father's behalf.
Navia
It was thanks to her that we were able to turn the tide, I wanted to thank her... I mean, there's also no point in being awkward all the time... so, we took the chance to reconcile with each other.
Paimon
Oh, that's great! Paimon also thought Clorinde wasn't actually a bad person. It's always good to have more friends.
Navia
Anyway, now that the case has finally been solved, perhaps it will slowly begin to fade from the public consciousness.
Navia
Oh, actually, there's still one last thing I need to do...
Paimon
What is it?
Navia
...I should pay a visit to my father's grave, and tell him the truth of what happened, as well as how it all ended.
Navia
And on top of that, just how much people still look up to him to this day...
Navia
...That includes me, too.
Silver
Miss Navia...
Melus
Indeed.
Traveler
...Can I come, too?
Paimon
Mhm, we want to go, too! We also think Callas is a really admirable person.
Navia
Sure thing. I'd like you two to share the moment with me. After all, without you, there might not have been such a positive ending.
Melus
Then in that case, everyone, let's be off. Considering the recent weather, we'll be lucky if we can reach Poisson before dark...
Navia
Yeah, you're right... It's been raining non-stop for a few days now.
[❔ Hidden]
Begin condition(s)
1). Started:
Go to the opera house to identify the culprit
Navia
Marcel, the head of Confrerie of Cabriere!
Confused Audience Member
Huh? What confrerie? Never heard of them in my life.
Thinking Audience Member
I've heard of them, but... weren't they Spina di Rosula's sister organization?
Ecstatic Audience Member
Ooh! Is this going to be friends-to-enemies type situation!?
Neuvillette
Please let me remind you, Miss Navia, that charging someone is an incredibly serious matter. Committing to the charge also means taking on the legal responsibilities associated with it.
Neuvillette
And if the charge fails, depending on the circumstances, you may also be charged with the crime of making a false accusation. Knowing this, do you still wish to charge this man?
Navia
Yes, I do.
Neuvillette
In that case, I declare the charge to be valid. Miss Navia and attorneys, please take your places on the court.
Neuvillette
Members of the Gardes, please contact Mr. Marcel right away so that he may stand trial.
???
After some time, a shocked and confused Marcel is brought to the stands.
Neuvillette
Mr. Marcel, you will not require an attorney, is that correct?
Marcel
Ah... Apologies, it all just happened so quickly, I still haven't figured out what's going on.
Marcel
I think an attorney won't be necessary. This is probably just a misunderstanding between me and Navia.
Neuvillette
Very well. In that case, since both sides have now arrived, Miss Navia, please present your charges.
Navia
I would like to take everyone back to three years ago, to the case of "Callas the Unfaithful."
Navia
Only through elucidating what really happened in that case can we connect all the dots for the serial disappearances case.
Marcel
Navia, do you really think I was the one who killed your father?
Marcel
Come on, why would I do that? Callas was my benefactor, and remember, both you and I only ran to the scene when we heard the sound of a gun.
Marcel
If that's enough to make me a suspect, wouldn't that make everyone at that banquet a suspect as well?
Furina
I, uh... I think there's no point in getting into the specifics right now. The audience doesn't even have the big picture yet. Even I'm... ahem, struggling to remember some details of that case.
Navia
Exactly correct, Your Honor. I must refresh everyone's memory about that case before I can explain my charge and reasoning.
Neuvillette
I see. In which case, I will recount the findings about that case as originally recorded by Maison Gardiennage.
Navia
(The one with the motive to kill was Jacques, not my father, and even so, Jacques still had no reason to pull the trigger.)
Navia
(In truth, the third person shot Jacques first, and was shot in turn by my father when my father seized the gun from him.)
Navia
(After that, the true culprit turned the third person into water, erasing all traces of him from the scene.)
Navia
Thank you for the summary, Your Honor. Of course, the Gardes' conclusion appeared quite sensible to us at the time.
Navia
However, we should revisit the case now that we've gained new information about the abilities of Water from the Primordial Sea.
Go to the cemetery next to Poisson
Navia
This is where my father's grave is... To be perfectly honest, even I haven't been back here for a long time.
Paimon
Huh, there's someone there already... Wait, that figure, it can't be...?
Navia
...
Paimon
Isn't that Neuvillette? Why would the Chief Justice be here... Eh, Navia?
Neuvillette
...Mm?
Navia
...
Neuvillette
...My apologies. I should have asked before coming to pay my respects.
Navia
Don't say that.
Neuvillette
Sorry about that.
Navia
Oh, I was trying to say there's no need for you to apologize.
Navia
I wanted to show my father how much I've grown, but still, I doubt I've grown to the point that even the Chief Justice would feel compelled to apologize to me over and over.
Neuvillette
In that case... I will stop apologizing for now.
Navia
You really could use some pointers on understanding human emotions, Monsieur Neuvillette...
Navia
In any case... why did you come to Poisson?
Neuvillette
Hmm... Well, ever since that day, I've been turning a question over and over in my head... Just what is justice, anyway?
Neuvillette
There was once a time when I didn't want to believe that there could be anything more important to humans than life itself.
Neuvillette
No, rather than that, it's probably more truthful to say I didn't believe humans were capable of resisting the most basic instinct of living things. That they could rebel against their own nature, or consider certain things to be more important than their own lives.
Neuvillette
Which is also why I didn't stop your father from beginning that fateful duel...
Neuvillette
I believed that a truly innocent man would never throw away his life like that. That there was nothing... should have been nothing more important than one's own continued survival.
Neuvillette
But Mr. Callas proved me utterly and decisively wrong.
Neuvillette
If not for his sacrifice, the serial disappearances case would have remained unsolved to this day.
Neuvillette
Mr. Callas made the choice he did for his daughter, for his associates, and for many people completely unrelated to him...
Neuvillette
And in the end, from a certain perspective, one could say that he did it all for the sake of justice.
Neuvillette
A justice that is higher than... life itself.
Neuvillette
So, you asked me why I came here.
Neuvillette
I just wanted to say my apologies to Mr. Callas in person... I should have noticed all of this much sooner.
Neuvillette
This regret has filled me with a sadness that has haunted me for days.
Neuvillette
That high and mighty chair in the Opera Epiclese indeed insulates one from many important things. Spina di Rosula, thank you so much for your hard work and perseverance.
Navia
I... I'm sorry for being mad at you before.
Navia
So you're actually... One of those types that's cold on the outside but pretty thoughtful on the inside, huh? That reminds me of Silver, one of my guys...
Neuvillette
Sorry about that. Self-expression is not one of my strong suits.
Navia
Didn't I just say you don't need to apologize...
Paimon
Huh, so Navia and Neuvillette seem to have made their peace as well...
Paimon
Let's not disturb them for now... We can wait until after they're done.
???
Following Navia and Neuvillette, you also pay your respects to Callas...
Paimon
Whew... Paimon's never paid respects at someone's grave before, did Paimon do anything rude there?
Traveler
Well, you're not usually supposed to fly around someone's grave.
Paimon
Huh? Paimon didn't know that was a thing... But... But Paimon doesn't know what she should do if she can't fly...
Paimon
Nooo... Paimon hopes Miss Navia won't be too mad...
Traveler
(Wow, she took it seriously...)
Paimon
Anyway, Neuvillette is still standing around there... It's not often that we can catch him alone like this, so why don't we go talk to him for a bit? If we can't talk to Lady Furina, we can at least talk to him, right?
[❔ Hidden]
Begin condition(s)
1). Started:
Look for clues in the headquarters' depths
Paimon
Oh look! There's an important-looking basin over here... and it's full of water!
Traveler
That must be the Water from the Primordial Sea.
Paimon
That means this is where they make all the Sinthe! And that special water is the main ingredient.
Paimon
If you dilute it with normal water, you'll get Sinthe, but the pure stuff can dissolve a human...
Paimon
Paimon will take notes on this incriminating evidence!
Talk to Neuvillette
Traveler
I have no more questions.
Neuvillette
Very well. It was my honor to provide you with what answers I could. I very much enjoyed conversing with you.
Neuvillette
It will soon be time for me to leave this blissful tranquility behind, and return to Palais Mermonia.
Paimon
You really are super busy, Monsieur Neuvillette! Paimon thought you only came here to pay your respects today because you had the day off.
Neuvillette
Crime and villainy do not have the day off, and so justice must work around the clock as well. This is merely the nature of a Justice's work.
Paimon
Alright, alright, you've got a point.
Paimon
Huh... Paimon just noticed that the rain has stopped.
[❔ Hidden] Face off against Marcel
